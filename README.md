# A Nice Bot

Say hello, to A Nice Bot. Created to learn Node.js and the Discord API, this bot is a general purpose bot to play around with and have fun, while at the same time providing many features such as server management.

You can find the website at http://anicebot.freemyip.com:8080/, but note that it is not always up, and the bot is still in development.

Created by The Noah.
